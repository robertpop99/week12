This program was made by Popescu Robert Gabriel, first year student at
University of Bristol.

My first optional is called Fractals and creates sketch files with some
animated fractals. It can create either triangles or squares, and you can set
the animation time (in milliseconds). It also needs to know the width and heigh
of your screen (the dimensions of the window created by SDL2). You can choose
how many times the fractal is repeated, but in the case of squares, it runs out
of memory if used with 7 or higher. The created sketch file can then be opened
with any program that has both stages completed (including mine).

My second optional is called Reversi and I did it in order to use some SDL2
graphics myself. It is based on the historical Reversi, and you can choose
with your mouse where to place your piece. It also shows you with grey pieces
where you can place. It can be run in multiple ways:
./reversi - the normal game with a 8 x 8 board and a 1280 x 720 window
./reversi test - run tests
./reversi n - the game has a board of n x n and a 1280 x 720 window
./reversi w h - the game has a 8 x 8 board and a w x h window
./revesi n w h - the game has a n x n board and a w x h window
